At **Kwang Tech Hub**, practices are how we turn values into concrete ways of working in Dschang. Our hackathons, workshops, peer-learning circles, and project sprints are all shaped by:

- Ubuntu (community first)
- Cooperation and mutual upliftment
- Cultural relevance and sensitivity to place
- Sustainability
- Simplicity in processes
- Quality over quantity

We document these practices so that students, mentors, and partners can replicate and evolve them in future cohorts and hubs.

If you're a practitioner or facilitator and would like to contribute a page on a given practice used at Kwang Tech Hub, please use the button below to share your proposal.

One of the hub team will review and upload to the practices folder upon acceptance.
