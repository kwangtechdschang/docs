Kwang Tech Hub is a community-driven technology hub based in **Dschang, West Region, Cameroon**. We create hands-on, locally grounded learning experiences in Web3 and software development so that students and builders can prototype **sustainable solutions to local issues**.

<Steps>
  ### Mission
  To leverage Web3, and specifically blockchain, to provide sustainable solutions to local issues.

  ### Vision
  To become a leader in biomimicry applied to software development.

  ### Roots
  We are grounded in African indigenous wisdom—especially **Ubuntu**—emphasising cooperation, mutual upliftment, and community-first principles.

  ### Values

  - Ubuntu (community first)
  - Cooperation
  - Mutual upliftment
  - Cultural relevance
  - Sustainability
  - Simplicity in processes
  - Quality over quantity

  ### Physical spaces
  Our activities are hosted across:

  - Office
  - Museum conference room

  ### Hackathon capacity
  We currently host hackathons and intensive learning programmes for **up to 50 participants**.

  ### Partnerships & collaborations

  - Disruptive IT — Software Development
  - SIZO Earth and Tomorrow — Culture, Art, Environmental Protection
  - Museum of Civilization — Venue Partner
  - MOOCK — Community Outreach

  ### Community story
  Kwang Tech Hub was created to provide hands-on experience to students in a region lacking practical, solution-oriented tech training structures. We support students and community members to develop **culturally relevant solutions** tailored to the environmental, social, and cultural context of their community.

  The hub was born from a partnership between **Disruptive IT** and **SIZO** at the **Ufulu Panafricain Library**, merging Web3 technology with culture, environmental stewardship, and art. Since then, the hub has focused on designing innovative and context-aware solutions for local issues.
